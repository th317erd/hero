The Architecture:

  1. System Token: Proficy uses a system-wide Meta Business Manager access token (META_ADS_ACCESS_TOKEN) to interact with Meta's API.
  2. Page-Level Permissions: When launching campaigns, the code calls retrive_page_access_token(page_id) at meta_ads.py:1656-1665:
  page = Page(page_id, api=self.api)
  retrieved_page = page.api_get(fields=["access_token"])
  return retrieved_page["access_token"]
  3. The Error: This call fails because the Proficy app no longer has permission to read the page's access_token field.

  Where to Fix This

  This is NOT fixed in Proficy's code or database. It must be fixed in Meta Business Suite (Facebook's interface):

  Option 1: Meta Business Suite
  1. Go to https://business.facebook.com
  2. Navigate to: Business Settings → Pages
  3. Find "Silko Honda" page (ID: 254768903284)
  4. Ensure the page is properly assigned with these permissions:
    - pages_read_engagement
    - pages_manage_ads
    - pages_show_list

  Option 2: Page Admin Re-authorization
  The Silko Honda Facebook page admin needs to:
  1. Go to their Page Settings → Business Integrations / Apps
  2. Find the Proficy app and grant the required permissions

  What Proficy's "Link/Unlink" Does

  The Link/Unlink buttons in Proficy at /accounts/{dealership_id}/meta-ads/link only:
  - Update the internal meta_ads_link_status field in the database
  - Don't change actual Facebook permissions

  The Silko Honda record shows meta_ads_link_status = 'Linked' but that doesn't mean Facebook has granted the permissions - it just means Proficy thinks it's linked.

  ---
  Bottom line: Someone with access to the Meta Business Manager needs to check why the Silko Honda Facebook page permissions were revoked and re-grant them.
