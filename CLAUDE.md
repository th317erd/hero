# Claude Code Instructions

## !!!MANDATORY FIRST ACTION!!!

**STOP. Before responding to the user, ask yourself: "Do I have the contents of `~/.claude-config/startup.md` in my current context?"**

If NO → Use the Read tool to read `~/.claude-config/startup.md` RIGHT NOW, before doing anything else.
If YES → Proceed normally.

This applies after every `/compact`, session start, or context reset. The file contains critical workflow rules and preferences.
